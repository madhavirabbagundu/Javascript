// asynchrounous functions are very important because, 
// suppose, we have lot of function is there, in that time it does wait for the another function
// it takes lot of time to implement the things. so, 
// the async funiton are the main things it will help for the more
// because, when we use the async function it will print the first main things then the another function 
// when we use the settimeout then async function is excuted
// it is very useful for us
